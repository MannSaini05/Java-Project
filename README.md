# Home Automation System
Respected Reviewers, We the members of [Team Haste]() (Mann Saini, Jatin Tomar, Divyansh Yadav and Divyansh ) are working on the project of [Home Automation System](). We have taken upon this project because most of the devices available in the market have the following shortcomings:

- They are high maintenance.
- They are usually available in high end appliances which are not available in every household.

Using this project we aim to use it on normal appliances while at the same time also increasing their lifespan. During this project we will be facing many obstacles and problem but we will stay focused on our path and try to complete the project on time.


Next up, we have used different tech stacks. As to the detailed explanation of how the project works, the same has been mentioned in the presentation attached.
